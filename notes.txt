zoom fix - check how it looks after making the original image full height

add gifs

remove unused asset files

remove 9999 for upload images when want to trigger the ci/cd

social media preview image for https://myvision.ai

delete travis-ci webhook if not going to be using it

delete CNAME

add margin to the description of the upload datasets modal

the labeller modal padding bottom looks low for higher screen scale

---------------------------------------------

Things to check on chrome browsers on other pcs:

weird auto horizontal rotate for some images on firefox

potential fix:
img {
    image-orientation: from-image;
}

shape labeller modal  horizontal and vertical overflow fake borders
label list dropdown horizontal and vertical overflow fake borders
machine learning generated labels horizontal and vertical overflow fake borders
make sure the dim effect is not choppy for slower pcs

-------------------------------------------------

UX:

concider the fact that after editing a label in continuous drawing mode, we should maybe go back to the drawing mode

check whether it is more approriate to add bounding boxes by holding key or clicking it multiple times

highlight shapes to indicate that the user needs to click on them to start adding/removing points - check if really needed

Check to see if the upload images and remove image button are not too high up, causing the user to click remove image when
their actual intention is to remove a shape. To fix this, can potentially move the buttons lower by increasing their padding top
or highlight the image to be removed (in red) on remove image button hover (border or potentially overlay)
Check to see if the new border functionality is not causing users to think that on hovering the delete shape button, the shape would
be highlighted

check if export datasets is enough of an indicator that it is a download functionality
(reason not using download is because the word is long for the popup)

Or maybe having the 'Download Datasets' popover and Export button is clear enough

Change the HTML naming conventions with the final decisions!!!!

--------------------------------------------------

the word "current" is used heavily within this project and should be replaced with "active"

ideally should write new code in a separate module to enable code splitting into separate chunks (check is sharing is required)

the dimensions used for recording examples were 1920x822

The export datasets button is not disabled on load time to enable the user explore the formats available

encode all non-alphanumeric symbols in index into entity code

Decided not to have a continue to edit polygon button on the popup as it made it look vulgar and does is not a functionality that users
would really want from the get-go as the rest of the polygon edit tools would enable them to ammend their polygons post creation

Decided not to use image segmentation because it works on pixel bases, where each and every boundary is drawn by an array of pixels
However, can be achieved by generating an algorithm that will draw polygons based on the boundaries found on the pixels variable's value
on line 318, file called as segment-annotator.js.

The following repo does use fabricjs, but to only draw a line;

The nice to haves:

when a user tries to drop an image on top of the app screen, it should automatically trigger uplaod (or in the case of uploading datasets - add to the mdodal)
https://webpack.js.org/guides/caching/#extracting-boilerplate

split up the result bundle into chunks to increase download

Use the following to identify the browser:

select multiple images or shapes to delete (via ctrl)

can update the image list thumbnails by taking screenshot from farbicjs canvas when something changes

the label should not track off the screen

polygon size reduction when zoomed in is a little bit off

I believe the bounding box drawing bottom edge is not working in horizontally narrow images going by the trend

control the darkness of the background

control the thickness of shape corner sizes

control the size of labels

change label colors

rebind keys

export custom settings

animations for image upload, new label create

should alert the user when unsaved changes before leaving (potentially too intrusive for new people)
