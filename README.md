Annotating objects can be a difficult task... You can skip all the hard work and use a pre-trained machine learning model to automatically annotate the objects for you. MyVision leverages the popular 'COCO-SSD' model to generate bounding boxes for your images and by operating locally on your browser - retain all data within the privacy of your computer:

You can import existing annotation projects and continue working on them in MyVision. This process can also be used to convert datasets from one format to another:
